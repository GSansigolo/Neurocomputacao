#' @description This function returns an empty sits tibble.
#' Sits tibbles are the main structures of sits package.
#' They contain both the satellite image time series and its metadata.
#' A sits tibble is a tibble with pre-defined columns that
#' has the metadata and data for each time series. The columns are
#' <longitude, latitude, start_date, end_date, label, coverage, time_series>.
#' Most functions of sits package get a sits tibble as input (with additional parameters)
#' and return another sits tibble as output. This allows chaining functions over sits tibbles.
#'
#' @return A sits tibble.
#' @export
