\title{Create a set of RasterLayer objects to store time series classification results}
\usage{
.sits_coverage_raster_classified(raster.tb, samples.tb, file, interval)
}
\arguments{
\item{raster.tb}{Tibble with metadata about the input RasterBrick objects.}

\item{samples.tb}{Samples used for training the classification model.}

\item{file}{Generic name of the files that will contain the RasterLayers.}

\item{interval}{Classification interval.}
}
\value{
A tibble with metadata about the output RasterLayer objects.
}
\description{
Takes a tibble containing metadata about a set of RasterBrick objects
containing time series (each Brick has information for one band) and creates a
set of RasterLayers to store the classification result. Each RasterLayer corresponds
to one time step. The time steps are specified in a list of dates.
